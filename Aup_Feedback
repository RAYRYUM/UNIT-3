Overall, Aup's UNIT-3 repository is simply well organised in terms of file mamagment aswell as internal file structure. The quiz files are organised without
clutter into one folder, and all quizzes contain a clear screenshot of the code in question, followed up by the output received in the same file. His codes respect
good coding practices and are easy to understand.
